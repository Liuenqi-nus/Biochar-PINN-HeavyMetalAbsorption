# Biochar-PINN-HeavyMetalAbsorption
By applying advanced deep learning techniques, I worked to optimize how biochar is made, aiming to make it more effective and efficient compared to traditional methods. This experience not only showcased my ability to think creatively and solve real-world problems but also demonstrated my proactive willingness to learn and apply cutting-edge technologies like AI in new and impactful ways.

The project applied a cutting-edge deep learning approach, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), to integrate domain-specific physics knowledge into AI modeling which shall be widely available to all the application domains of AI. The AI model must respect all the physical laws to make it safe and controllable. I actively contributed to critical components of this initiative, including:

  **Conducting extensive literature review and data preparation**: building a dataset with 1,083 data points derived from 33 academic papers.
  
  **Model selection and training**: By inputting 25 features from three key biochar processes (preparation, modification, and adsorption) into PINNs, we achieved notable performance metrics (train R^2 = 0.99, validation R^2 = 0.92, test R^2 = 0.81) â€”significantly outperforming traditional models such as DNN, RF, and XGBoost. 
  
  **Innovative Multi-Objective Optimization**: The model accelerated experimental processes and optimized biochar design for metrics like adsorption efficiency and speed, offering insights into potential new physical mechanisms.
  
  **Incorporating SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis** to improve model transparency and reliability, quantifying feature contributions to guide model refinement and optimization.
